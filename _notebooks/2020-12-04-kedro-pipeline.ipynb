    "p.s. When using kedro pipeline, you only define the node's inputs and outputs, but you never defined the order of execution. From my experience, there are pros and cons. The benefits is, your code is less coupled, and due to this, kedro is able to execute your pipeline in parallel whenever possible to speed up your program. However, it means the order of execution is not guaranteed, this may cause unexpected effect. For example, if you are training a machine learning model, it is common to set a random seed at the beginning. Due to the randomness of execution, you may not get identical result, as the order of execution is different everytime, thus the sequence of the random number used is random too. In general this is not a big problem, but if you have a strong need to make sure you have identical output (e.g. regression test), it may cause some trouble and you need to use dummy input and output to force kedro run your pipeline in a specific order."
