    "If you have ever written SQL queries to extract data from a database, chances are you are familiar with an IDE like the screenshot below. The IDE offers features like auto-completion, visualize the query output, display the table schema and the ER diagram. Whenever you need to write a query, this is your go-to tool. However, you may want to add `Jupyter Notebook` into your toolkit. It improves my productivity by complementing some missing features in IDE."

    "As a data scientist/data analyst, you write SQL queries for ad-hoc analyses all the time. After getting the right data, you make nice-looking charts and put them in a PowerPoint and you are ready to present your findings. Unlike a well-defined ETL job, you are exploring the data and testing your hypotheses all the time. You make assumptions, which is often wrong but you only realized it after a few weeks. But all you got is a CSV that you cannot recall how it was generated in the first place.\n",

    "Data is not stationary, why should your analysis be? I have seen many screenshots, fragmented scripts flying around in organizations. As a data scientist, I learned that you need to be cautious about what you heard. Don't trust peoples' words easily, verify the result!  To achieve that, we need to know exactly how the data was extracted, what kind of assumptions have been made? Unfortunately, this information usually is not available. As a result, people are redoing the same analysis over and over. You will be surprised that this is very common in organizations. In fact, numbers often do not align because every department has its own definition for a given metric. It is not shared among the organization, and verbal communication is inaccurate and error-prone. It would be really nice if anyone in the organization can reproduce the same result with just a single click. Jupyter Notebook can achieve that reproducibility and keep your entire analysis (documentation, data, and code) in the same place."
