    "## Bulletproof Python – Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis\n",
    "The term **property based testing** isn't too important. In a nutshell `hypothesis` is a python library that help you to write (better) tests by modifying your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ~~Prepare mock data~~ Provide a specification of data, let `hypothesis` do the work\n",
    "2. Perform some operation\n",
    "3. Assert the result with expected value\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale behind this is\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: ** People write code don't come up with good test. **\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can generate  integers with `hypotesis.strategies.integers`, it does something smart under the hood so it's not just random number but more meaningful test. For example, you usually want to test for zero, negative number, positive number, large number. `hypoethsis` try to maximize the variety of tests and you just need to give it a specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also generate more sophisticated data, for example, a tuple of two integers, where the second integer has to be larger than the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@st.composite\n",
    "\n",
    "def list_and_index(draw, elements=st.integers()):\n",
    "    first = draw(elements)\n",
    "    second = draw(st.integers(min_value=first + 1))\n",
    "    return (first, second)\n",

    "* In case of you don't know what's the expected answer, how do you write test that fails meaningfully?\n",
    "\n",
    "I jump out of the session because of a call, so not too many comments about this session. In general I like the idea of TDD but struggle to apply the textbook version of TDD as examples are often much simpler than the real application.\n",
