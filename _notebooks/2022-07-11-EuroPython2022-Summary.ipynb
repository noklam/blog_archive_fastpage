    "1. ~~Prepare mock data~~ Provide a specification of data, let `hypothesis` do the work\n",
    "2. Perform some operation\n",
    "3. Assert the result with expected value\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale behind this is\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: ** People write code don't come up with good test. **\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can generate  integers with `hypotesis.strategies.integers`, it does something smart under the hood so it's not just random number but more meaningful test. For example, you usually want to test for zero, negative number, positive number, large number. `hypoethsis` try to maximize the variety of tests and you just need to give it a specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also generate more sophisticated data, for example, a tuple of two integers, where the second integer has to be larger than the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@st.composite\n",
    "\n",
    "def list_and_index(draw, elements=st.integers()):\n",
    "    first = draw(elements)\n",

The main difference is that `spawn process` will re-import all the Python modules in the new process and cause some issues.
