            "title": "The missing piece in Python tutorial - What is dispatch why you should care",
            "content": "In python, we often think of it as a dynamic language, and type is barely noticed in Python as you can change the type of a variable whenever you want. . Since Python 3.4(PEP443)[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0443/], generic function is added to Python. This add a new feature that I found much of the exsiting tutorial does not cover it. Such feature is common in other language and is very useful to keep your code concise and clean. . In python, you cannot overload a normal function twice for different behavior base on the arguments. For example: . def foo(number:int ): print(&#39;it is a integer&#39;) def foo(number: float): print(&#39;it is a float&#39;) . foo(1) . it is a float . The definition simply get replaced by the second definition. However, with singledispatch, you can define the function behavior base on the type of the argument. . from functools import singledispatch @singledispatch def foo(number ): print(f&#39;{type(number)}, {number}&#39;) . foo(1) . &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;, 1 . We can now register the function for different argument type. . @foo.register(int) def _(data): print(&#39;It is a integer!&#39;) @foo.register(float) def _(data): print(&#39;It is a float!&#39;) @foo.register(dict) def _(data): print(&#39;It is a dict!&#39;) . foo(1.0) foo(1) foo({&#39;1&#39;:1}) . It is a float! It is a integer! It is a dict! . How is this possible? Basically there are multiple version of a generic function, singlepatch will pick the correct one base on the type of the first argument. . It will fallback to the most generic function if the type of argument is not registered. . foo([1,2,3]) . &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt;, [1, 2, 3] . I hope you can see how this is going to be useful. singledispatch limited the usage to the first argument of a function. But we can actually do more than that. . In next post I will cover the patch method from fastai will leverage singledispatch more to do multi-dispatch. In python, everything is just an object, even a function itself. So there is no reason why you can only dispatch to a function object. In fact, you could dispatch method to a class too. . Fastai @typedispatch . Single Dispatch is great, but what if we can do multi dispatch for more than 1 argument? . from fastcore.dispatch import typedispatch, TypeDispatch . Let us first try if this work as expected . @typedispatch def add(x:int, y:int): return x+y @typedispatch def add(x:int, y:str): return x + int(y) . print(add(1,2)) print(add(1,&#39;2&#39;)) print(add(&#39;a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;)) . 3 3 a . add(1,2) . 3 . add(1,&#39;2&#39;) . 3 . But what if we added something does not define? . add(&#39;2&#39;,1) . &#39;2&#39; . &#39;2&#39;? where does it come from? Let&#39;s have a look at the definition of typedispatch and understand how it works. . ??typedispatch class DispatchReg: &quot;A global registry for `TypeDispatch` objects keyed by function name&quot; def __init__(self): self.d = defaultdict(TypeDispatch) def __call__(self, f): nm = f&#39;{f.__qualname__}&#39; self.d[nm].add(f) return self.d[nm] . In fact, typedispatch is not even a function, it&#39;s an instance! In python, everything is an object. With the __call__ method, we can use an instance just liek a function. And the typedispatch is just an instance of DispatchReg . type(typedispatch) . fastcore.dispatch.DispatchReg . typedispatch store a dictionary inside, when you first register your function, it actually store inside a dict. As shown previously, you cannot define the same function twice. But you actually can, because function is nothing but just an object! Let me show you. . def foo(): return &#39;foo&#39; a = foo def foo(): return &#39;not foo&#39; b = foo . foo() . &#39;not foo&#39; . foo() is replaced by the latest definition indeed, but we store a copy of the original function as a variable. . a() . &#39;foo&#39; . b() . &#39;not foo&#39; . hex(id(a)), hex(id(b)) . (&#39;0x2b9d28bb5e8&#39;, &#39;0x2b9d2ebe048&#39;) . The two function is nothing other than two Python object. typedispatch make use of these, when you register a new function, you create an new object and stored inside typedispatch dictionary. It then checks your type annotation and find the corresponding type until it match the issubclass condition. . typedispatch.d . defaultdict(fastcore.dispatch.TypeDispatch, {&#39;cast&#39;: (object,object) -&gt; cast, &#39;add&#39;: (int,str) -&gt; add (int,int) -&gt; add}) . So back to our question, why does add(&#39;a&#39;,1) return &#39;a&#39;? The following explain the reasons. When you call your method, you are really calling the __call__ method inside TypeDispatch, and when the signature is not find, it will simply return the first argument. . def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs): ts = L(args).map(type)[:2] f = self[tuple(ts)] if not f: return args[0] if self.inst is not None: f = MethodType(f, self.inst) return f(*args, **kwargs) .",

Implementation In the original article, the authors suggested three things: . Create two separate dataloaders and draw a batch from each at every iteration to mix them up | Draw a t value following a beta distribution with a parameter alpha (0.4 is suggested in their article) | Mix up the two batches with the same value t. | Use one-hot encoded targets | Source: https://forums.fast.ai/t/mixup-data-augmentation/22764 (Sylvain Gugger) . Beta Distribution . Beta distribution is control by two parameters, α and β with interval [0, 1], which make it useful for Mixup. Mixup is basically a superposition of two image with a parameter t.

In essence, it compose different files to a large config setting. It offers you the common Object Oriented Programming with YAML file. Allow you to have clear structure of configurations. . Assume you have a config.yaml like this, where run_mode and hyperparmeter are separate folder to hold different choice of parameters. You can set defaults for them with the following structure. .
