# 1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio



Complexity O\(N \* LogN\) + O\(K \* LogN\)

1. We need to sort the list once
2. Then for each update, we need to insert the tuple in an ordered list \(Log N\) \* k

## Learning point

* A heap would simplify the implementation a lot, as I am basically implementing heap here.
* list.pop\(0\) is O\(n\) while deque.popleft\(\) is O\(1\)
* User HEAP! 

```python
from typing import List
from bisect import insort


def average(classes):
    ratios = []
    for i in classes:
        ratios.append(i[0] / i[1])
    return sum(ratios) / len(ratios)


def delta(x, y):
    return -(y - x) / (y ** 2 + y)


class Solution:
    def maxAverageRatio(self, classes: List[List[int]], extraStudents: int) -> float:
        order = []
        for x in classes:
            order.append(delta(x[0], x[1]))
        d = []
        for i, v in enumerate(order):
            t = tuple([v,i])
            d.append(t)
        order = sorted(d)
        while extraStudents > 0 and order:
            selected_tuple = order.pop(0)
            value,index  = selected_tuple

            c = classes[index]
            pass_, total_ = c
            if pass_ == total_:
                continue
                
            c[0] = pass_ + 1
            c[1] = total_ + 1
            extraStudents = extraStudents - 1
            
            new_value = delta(c[0], c[1])
            new_tuple = (new_value, index, )
            insort(order, new_tuple)
            if extraStudents <= 0:
                break
        return average(classes)
```
